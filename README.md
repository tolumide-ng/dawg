## NOTE:
1. THIS CRATE IS NOT PRODUCTION READY YET (Use at your own risk)
2. Contributions are welcome, but I am not actively accepting any at the moment, unless it's really crucial, Sorry
3. I am very busy at the moment, so finishing this up might take sometime, but I definitely have plans to do that.
4. This isn't a feature complete implementation as I only added some of the features, I need.
